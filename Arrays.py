This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).







Array in Python can be created by importing an array module. array( data_type , value_list ) is used to create array in Python with data type and value list specified in its arguments.




Elements can be added to the Python Array by using built-in insert() function. Insert is used to insert one or more data elements into an array. Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array. append() is also used to add the value mentioned in its arguments at the end of the Python array.
